      <h2><p>
        
      &nbsp;  Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics,
        so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, 
        the Fibonacci Quarterly. </p>
       <p>&nbsp; Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer
        algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure,
        and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems.
      </p><p> &nbsp; They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem,
        the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern and
        the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts.
